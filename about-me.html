    Description: This website operates as a portfolio of projects I have worked on. At the moment
    it is rudimentary and a work in progress for future improvements.

    Update 5/18/2022 per HTML5 100 Lesson 5 Assignment. 
        - Redesigned CSS to include FlexBox styling.
        - Articles now as FlexBox items and not list items.
        - Adjusted positioning and style of header and footer.
        - Incorporated Google Fonts and change font of most text.
        - Added FontAwesome icon links for social media footer links.
        - Removed href from text links and created clickable buttons.
        - All links now use JS 'onclick' function.

    ToDo: add transitions to menus.
